Solutions Architect with over 8 years experience in analytics, with a focus on serverless architectures and enterprise analytics modernization. Huge believer in [Gall's Law](https://personalmba.com/galls-law/), which I consider a guiding principle both in my individual designs as well as overall strategy.
